    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
<h4>Contact: <tt>dhroger<img height=10 width=10 src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/43px-At_sign.svg.png">sandia.gov</tt></h4>
<blockquote><em>“We have to do better at producing tools to support the whole research cycle – from data capture and data curation to data analysis and data visualization”  Jim Gray, The Fourth Paradigm</em></blockquote>

<p>
Most areas of science, simulations and experiments are flooded with data, with some areas facing exabytes of data in near term. This includes not only static, but also dynamic datasets (where data is continuously streamed and need to be analyzed in real time). This trend towards more data is likely to continue in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>
Everyone – from scientists and artists to citizens and representatives – faces daunting problems in making use of this expanding digital resource. Our ability to manage, mine, analyze, and visualize the data is fundamental to the knowledge discovery process. The value of data at extreme scale can be fully realized only if we have end-to-end solutions, which demands collective, inter-disciplinary efforts to develop.</p>

<p>
The <b>Large Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV)</b> symposium, to be held in conjunction with <a href="http://visweek.org/">IEEE VisWeek 2011</a>, is specifically targeting solutions to this end-to-end problem.  It requires attention from a range of experts – from computer science and beyond  – the goal of the LDAV symposium is to bring together domain scientists, data analytics and visualization researchers, users, designers and artists to foster common ground for solving problems that face us now, and those that face us in the years ahead.</p>

<h3>
Papers</h3>
<b>Papers Submission Deadline: Reference <a href="dates.php.html">LDAV Important Dates</a></b><br>

<b>Papers Format Requirements can be found <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~vis/Tasks/camera.html"a>here.</a></b>

<p>
All papers should be directly related to collection, analysis, manipulation or visualization of <b>large-scale data</b>.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data collection, management and curation</li>
<li>Novel, extreme or innovative methods for understanding and interacting with data</li>
<li>Streaming methods for analysis, collection and visualization</li>
<li>Advanced hardware for data handling or visualization</li>
<li>Collaboration or co-design of data analysis with domain scientists</li>
<li>Distributed or Multi-threaded approaches</li>
<li>MapReduce-based methods, algorithms or approaches</li>
<li>Hierarchical data storage, retrieval or rendering</li>
<li>Novel interaction techniques specific to large data</li>
<li>Topics in cognitive issues specific to manipulating and understanding large data</li>
<li>Case studies (4 pages is sufficient)</li>
<li>Industry solutions for large data</li>
</ul>
<p>
Papers on any topic can be short (4 pages) or long (8 pages), with the author determining length based on the content.  Papers shall be formatted according to guidelines available on the LDAV site.  Because the symposium will include a variety of presentation lengths, the LDAV committee will offer presentation slots independent of the length of paper.</p>

<b>To submit your paper, please go to the <a href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/LDAV2011" /a>LDAV 2011 submission site.</a></b>

<br>
<h2>Call for Posters</h2>
<h4>Contact: <tt>hwshen<img height=10 width=10 src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/At_sign.svg/43px-At_sign.svg.png">cse.ohio-state.edu</tt></h4>

<p>We invite you to submit unpublished work to the LDAV poster program. The poster program is a venue designed to highlight ongoing research and late breaking topics that have produced promising preliminary results. In addition to the topics listed under call for papers,  we also  welcome submissions that showcase successful stories of applying visualization to large-scale data intensive applications .  The poster program will be  a great opportunity for the authors to interact with the symposium attendees and solicit feedback. </p>

<p> Interested authors should submit a two-page abstract that describes the underlying problem, the proposed method, and  preliminary results. Accepted poster abstracts will be published as part of the proceedings. The format of the abstract will be the same as  the format used for  the regular paper submission. <b>The dimensions of the posters should not exceed the A0 space (841mm x 1189mm / 33.1 ” x 46.8 ”) </b>. Poster authors are encouraged, but not required, to include a draft or sketch of the poster layout and content in their submission to help reviewers and show that the poster format is being used effectively. This should be in PDF format. The authors  should indicate if the poster will be accompanied by an on-site demonstration and/or  videos. </p>

<b>To submit your Poster, please go to the <a href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/LDAV2011" /a>LDAV 2011 submission site.</a></b><br>
